				<h2>Building an open digital economy</h2>
				<br /><br />
				<p>
					OpenSea is the world's largest marketplace for crypto collectibles and
					non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We're building a new kind of economy,
					where every item is owned and traded by its creator. OpenSea is a
					marketplace for buying and selling NFTs. We're committed to making
					NFTs accessible to everyone, and we're working to build a community of
					creators and collectors.
					<br />
					<br />
					A core part of our vision is that open protocols like Ethereum and
					interoperable standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 will enable vibrant
					new economies. We're building tools that allow consumers to trade
					their items freely, creators to launch new digital works, and
					developers to build rich, integrated marketplaces for their digital
					items.
					<br />
					While CryptoKitties felt like a toy to many, it represented a dramatic
					shift in how we interact with items in the digital world. While
					previous digital items lived on company servers, blockchain-native
					items lived on shared, public blockchains owned by no single party.
					They could be viewed anywhere, exchanged openly, and truly owned in a
					way that was never before possible in the digital world. <br />
					<br />Fascinated by the movement that was forming, Devin Finzer and
					Alex Atallah joined early adopter communities in Discord and started
					talking to users. With the OpenSea beta launch in December 2017, the
					first open marketplace for any non-fungible token on the Ethereum
					blockchain was born. Today, we’re proud to remain the largest general
					marketplace for user-owned digital items, supporting multiple
					blockchains, with the broadest set of categories and the best prices
					for new emerging digital item classes. As a company, we’re thrilled to
					be at the center of this growing industry, and will continue to invest
					in our core infrastructure as we build the most accessible marketplace
					for buyers, sellers, and creators.

				<h3>Security Reports</h3>
				<br />
				<p>
					OpenSea strives to be the most trustworthy and secure marketplace for
					NFTs. Finding and eliminating current vulnerabilities is a top
					priority. OpenSea highly values our partnership with the vulnerability
					hunting community and as such we ensure all reports are reviewed by
					security experts and acted upon appropriately.
